    <h1>Please quickstart</h1>

    <h2>System requirements</h2>
    <p>Please supports Linux and OSX at the moment. We're internally using Ubuntu Trusty and Yosemite but it should
      work on other reasonably recent distros.</p>

    <h2>Installing</h2>
    <p><code>curl https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/please-build/get_plz.sh | bash</code></p>
    <p>This will download and install the latest version of Please on your system.</p>
    <p>You'll also need PyPy installed, including the .so which is not present in the usual
      Debian / Ubuntu packages of it. We suggest downloading the latest version from
      <a href="http://pypy.org/download.html">pypy.org</a> and following their instructions.<br/>
      If you're using another distro that has a packaged version, make sure you add the shared
      library (e.g. <code>USE=shared</code> on Gentoo).<br/>
      <code>brew install pypy</code> should work on OSX though.
    </p>
    <p>Alternatively you can use CPython (currently only version 2 is supported) as long as you
      have cffi installed; <code>pip install cffi>=1.5.0</code> should take care of it.</p>

    <h2>Shell completion</h2>
    <p>There are a couple of shell completion scripts available:<p>

    <p>Bash: <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/please-build/plz_complete.sh">https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/please-build/plz_complete.sh</a><br/>
      Download it and <code>source</code> it from your <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>

    <p>zsh: <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/please-build/plz_complete.zsh">https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/please-build/plz_complete.zsh</a><br/>
      Download, rename to _plz and put it somewhere in your $fpath,
      e.g. <code>/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions</code></p>

    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>Run <code>plz init</code> at the root of your repo to create the .plzconfig file.
      There are many options that can be configured in this file but you can worry about them
      later - the defaults should be fine to begin with.</p>

    <p>You will need to write some BUILD files to define how to compile your code.
      Carry on to <a href="basics.html">Please Basics</a> which will explain more about it.
    </p>
